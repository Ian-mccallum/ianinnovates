                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Hello! I'm a 17-year-old senior at Metea Valley High School, and I'm excited to share a little bit about who I am, what I do, and what I love. I currently live in the suburbs of Chicago, but I was born in the city and spent the first five years of my life there. At home, I'm surrounded by my three energetic younger sisters, my supportive parents, and our adorable dog Zoey. Together, we've created countless memories—some chaotic and some peaceful—that have shaped the person I've become.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="about-section mb-5">
                        <h2>Early Influences</h2>
                        <p>Growing up, I had the privilege of visiting my grandparents' home in the Northwoods of Wisconsin. Picture peaceful lakes, towering pines, and jaw-dropping autumn colors that look like they've been painted by Mother Nature herself. Spending time up there taught me to appreciate the serenity of the outdoors, fueling my curiosity and love for the natural world. Even now, whenever I find a chance to escape the hustle of suburban life, I'm drawn to exploring lakes, forests, and other hidden pockets of nature.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="about-section mb-5">
                        <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
                        <p>Although I'm only 17, I've always been someone who thinks big and dreams of bigger. One of my main goals is to start my own business and achieve financial freedom one day. I'd say my strongest trait is my work ethic—when something captures my attention, I pour myself into it until I see results. I was diagnosed with ADHD, which I initially struggled to accept, but I've learned to see it as my superpower. It can be challenging at times, but it also allows me to become hyperfocused on subjects I'm passionate about—turning those passions into real accomplishments.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="about-section mb-5">
                        <h2>Technical Journey</h2>
                        <p>I've been coding since I was ten years old, starting with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At school, my favorite classes have been AP European History, AP Psychology, and Web Design. AP Euro taught me the art of studying and retaining mountains of information, while AP Psych opened my eyes to the reasons behind human behavior. Web Design inspired me to return to that childhood passion of building digital projects. Another big part of my learning curve has been my foray into investing. During the pandemic, when I was just 12, I began exploring the world of cryptocurrency. Today, I hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink, Polygon, and a few other altcoins.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="about-section mb-5">
                        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                        <p>For over a year now, I've been working part-time at Target in the food department. This experience taught me what it's like to juggle physical work (think hauling groceries and stocking shelves) while also handling customer needs. Dealing with several customers a day really honed my people skills and showed me how important a friendly attitude can be—even in fast-paced, sometimes stressful situations.</p>
                        <p>On the weekends, you might also find me on the sidelines, whistle in hand, reffing kids' soccer games, both indoor and outdoor. I started reffing when I was 11, and I quickly learned that, no matter what decision you make, not everyone will be happy. Having parents yell at you from the stands definitely builds confidence—I realized I'm in control of the game, and if someone's upset, that's okay.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="about-section mb-5">
                        <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
                        <p>In addition to my part-time jobs, I'm also active in school clubs. One of my favorites is UNICEF, where I've served as a board member for two years. I help create fun activities that raise awareness and fundraise money for the club's mission of helping children in need. I'm thankful to be part of something that makes a positive difference in the world and allows me to sharpen my creative skills at the same time.

                    <div class="about-section mb-5">
                        <h2>Current Projects</h2>
                        <p>Right now, I'm working on launching an automation consulting agency called "Beat the Clock." The idea is to help businesses save time by integrating different services through tools like Zapier and Make. My next goal is to incorporate artificial intelligence into this project because I genuinely believe AI is the future. Whether I'm coding, researching new tech, or brainstorming marketing ideas, I love the thrill of pushing my own boundaries.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, I'm in the early stages of starting a nonprofit organization focused on cleaning up garbage and keeping my city clean. This initiative stems from my love for the outdoors and my desire to give back to the community that has shaped me. I believe that small actions can lead to big changes, and I'm excited to organize volunteer events, partner with local businesses, and create awareness campaigns that inspire others to take pride in our shared environment.</p>

                        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Below, I've detailed some of my favorite hobbies and interests. I hope you enjoy getting to know me a bit better!</p>
                        
                        <div class="hobby-item mb-4">
                            <h3>Soccer</h3>
                            <p>Soccer has been part of my life for as long as I can remember, thanks to my dad, who's been crazy about the sport forever. I've played on high school and club teams, and there's nothing quite like the rush of a good match, the smell of the grass, and the bond you form with your teammates. Soccer gives me an outlet to channel my energy and push myself physically, all while having a blast with friends.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="hobby-item mb-4">
                            <h3>Weightlifting</h3>
                            <p>Weightlifting is a newer passion of mine, but one that's quickly become important. My dad, who's been lifting since his college days, encouraged me to start. I love feeling my strength grow every time I add more weight or bust out a few extra reps. It's not just about muscle—it's also about self-discipline. When life gets overwhelming, hitting the gym helps clear my head and remind me that I'm capable of breaking my own limits.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="hobby-item mb-4">
                            <h3>Fishing</h3>
                            <p>Fishing holds a special place in my heart, largely because it connects me back to my childhood and my family. Growing up, I was lucky to have a pond just a few steps away from my house. My closest friends also enjoyed fishing, so we spent countless afternoons casting lines and sharing laughs. As we got older and gained access to cars, we started exploring nearby lakes, always chasing the next big catch. My grandpa also played a huge role in this hobby. He lives near a beautiful lake in Wisconsin and would take me out on his boat whenever I visited, buying me lures and teaching me different techniques. Every cast brings a mix of anticipation and relaxation—two feelings I treasure.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="hobby-item mb-4">
                            <h3>Photography & Videography</h3>
                            <p>My interest in photography and videography sprouted back in eighth grade, during a Visual Media class that opened my eyes to how powerful and creative these mediums can be. I now own a Canon EOS Rebel DSLR, which I use to capture the beauty of everyday life—from the stunning fall colors in Wisconsin to candid moments with my friends. Recently, I added a camcorder to my toolkit, letting me record more dynamic and playful videos of our hangouts and explorations. For me, taking photos and shooting videos is all about storytelling. I love freezing special moments in time and creating something that I can look back on years later with a smile.</p>

                            <h3>Video Editing & YouTube Content Creation</h3>
                            <p>During quarantine, I decided to share my passion for gaming by starting a YouTube channel called "Vokel." While I was at it, I also began streaming on Twitch under the same name. Reaching Twitch Affiliate status and growing my YouTube subscriber count to nearly 500 was incredibly exciting—it showed me that creativity and persistence do pay off. In the process, I developed a strong interest in video editing, learning programs like Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro. I even had the chance to edit videos for a YouTuber with over 2,000 subscribers. Video editing is like a puzzle: you take all the scattered pieces of footage and shape them into a coherent story. It's both challenging and deeply rewarding, especially when you see the final product and know you've put your unique spin on it.</p>

If you'd like to connect, chat, or simply say hello, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to meeting new people, exploring new ideas, and embracing fresh opportunities!</p>
